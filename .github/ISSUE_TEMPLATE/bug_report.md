**Describe the bug**
A clear and description of what the bug is.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Test case**

If applicable, it would really help if you can add an end-to-end test-case to the `packages/example` project.

The package allows you to do the following:
- Modify the database schema at `packages/example/sql/schema.sql`.
- Define your SQL query as a `.ts` or `.sql` anywhere in the `packages/example/src` directory.
- Run your SQL as a Jest test case in `packages/example/src/index.test.ts`

Please refer to `contributing.md` for details on how to run the `example` package.
